        Steve Krug’s Don’t Make Me Think is a guide to web usability. The core message: Websites should be obvious, self-explanatory, and effortless to use. If users have to stop and think about how something works, the design has failed.

                    <h3  class="bold-text1">🔑 Core Ideas</h3> <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >1. Don’t Make Me Think</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users shouldn’t wonder “How do I…?”<br></li>
                            <li>Navigation, links, and buttons must be clear and intuitive.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >2. Users Scan, They Don’t Read</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People glance through pages instead of reading word-for-word.<br></li>
                            <li>Design for scanning: headings, bullet points, visual hierarchy.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >3. Clicking Is Cheap</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users don’t mind clicking as long as they feel confident each click takes them closer to their goal.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >4. Design for the Way People Actually Use Sites</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most users muddle through rather than figure things out logically.<br></li>
                            <li>Good design tolerates mistakes and still helps users succeed.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >4. Navigation & Structure</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clear menus, visible hierarchy, and logical grouping are essential.<br></li>
                            <li>A consistent “You are here” indicator prevents confusion.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >4. Usability Testing</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Small, quick, and frequent tests are more valuable than big, expensive studies.<br></li>
                            <li>Watching real people use your site reveals issues you can’t predict.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>
