            Norman explains design through three cognitive and emotional levels:
            <br>
            <br>

            <span class="bold-text1" > 1. Visceral Design (Appearance & First Impressions)</span>

            Immediate, instinctive emotional reaction.

            Focuses on look, feel, and sensory appeal.

            Example: The sleekness of an iPhone or the sound of a luxury car door closing. <br>
            <br>

            <span class="bold-text1" > 2. Behavioral Design (Usability & Functionality)</span>

            

            Concerned with performance, ease of use, and effectiveness.

            Good behavioral design makes the product useful, understandable, and satisfying.

            Example: Google Search’s simple interface—it just works. <br>
            <br>

            <span class="bold-text1" >3. Reflective Design (Meaning & Personal Value)</span>


            

            Taps into our self-image, personal memories, and cultural meaning.

            It’s about how owning or using a product makes us feel about ourselves.

            Example: Wearing a Rolex watch may symbolize success and identity beyond just telling time.

             <h3  class="bold-text1">Key Takeaways</h3> <br>

            
            <span class="bold-text1" > Attractive things work better:</span>

                 Positive emotions can make us more tolerant of minor usability flaws. <br>

                 <span class="bold-text1" > Design = Function + Emotion:</span>
                Design = Function + Emotion: Utility alone isn’t enough; products must also connect emotionally.
                <br>
                 <span class="bold-text1" >Emotions influence problem-solving:</span>

                 Positive feelings make people more creative and flexible when using products.

                Successful products balance all three levels: The best designs delight us instantly (visceral), work seamlessly (behavioral), and carry meaning (reflective).

             <h3  class="bold-text1">Why It Matters for Designers</h3> <br>

                Design isn’t just problem-solving; it’s experience-shaping. <br>

                Emotional design helps build brand loyalty, desirability, and deeper user engagement. <br>

                Norman emphasizes that good design speaks to both heart and mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>


                <h3  class="bold-text1">In short:</h3> <br>
             <span class="bold-text1" > We don’t just use products we experience them.</span>

                And when design appeals to our emotions, we love them more, forgive their flaws, and form lasting connections.
