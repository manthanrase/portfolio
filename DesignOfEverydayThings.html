        The Design of Everyday Things
      </h2>
      <div class="sub-head">
        Donald Norman‚Äôs The Design of Everyday Things explains how good design isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics, but about making products usable, understandable, and human-centered. It explores how people interact with objects and why poor design leads to frustration.

                    <h3  class="bold-text1">üîë Core Ideas</h3> <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >1. Affordances & Signifiers</span> <br>
                    Affordance = what actions are possible (e.g., a button can be pushed). <br>
                    Signifier = signals that show what to do (e.g., ‚ÄúPush‚Äù label on a door).<br>
                    Good design makes actions obvious.<br>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >2. Feedback</span> <br>
                    Users need immediate, clear feedback after an action. <br>
                    Example: Elevator buttons that light up when pressed.<br>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >3. Mapping</span> <br>
                    Controls should match the outcome naturally. <br>
                    Example: Stove knobs arranged in the same layout as burners reduce confusion.<br>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >4. Conceptual Models</span> <br>
                    People form mental models of how things work. If design aligns with these models, usage feels intuitive.<br>
                    Example: File ‚Äúfolders‚Äù on computers mirror real-life folders.<br>
                    <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >5. Constraints</span> <br>
                    Good design limits possible actions to reduce mistakes. <br>
                    Example: A USB plug fits only one way (though Norman jokes about how often we still get it wrong!).<br>
                    <br>

                    <h3  class="bold-text1">üéØ Key Takeaways</h3> <br>

                    <span class="bold-text1" >1. Affordances & Signifiers</span> <br>
                    <span class="bold-text1" >Design is about humans, not machines:</span>
                        Failures usually come from poor design, not ‚Äúuser error.‚Äù<br>
                        <span class="bold-text1" >Iterative design matters:</span>
                         Products should be tested, redesigned, and improved with real user feedback.<br>
                        <span class="bold-text1" >Simplicity wins:</span>
                         Clear, minimal, and intuitive interfaces make products enjoyable.<br>
                        Human-centered design balances what is technologically possible with what people actually need.

                    <h3  class="bold-text1">üåç Why It Matters for Designers</h3> <br>
                        Empowers designers to shift blame from ‚Äúclumsy users‚Äù to ‚Äúbad design.‚Äù<br>
                        Encourages testing with real users to uncover hidden pain points.<br>
                        Helps create everyday products that delight instead of frustrate.<br>
                        Builds empathy designers must step into the user‚Äôs shoes.

                            Norman reminds us that good design:</span> <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Makes functions visible.‚Äù<br></li>
                            <li>Provides clear feedback.<br></li>
                            <li>Matches human expectations.<br></li>
                            <li>When done right, design reduces confusion, prevents errors, and brings joy to everyday life.<br></li>       
                        </ul>
